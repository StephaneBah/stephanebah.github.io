The main objective of this project is to develop a classification model capable of differentiating dogs and cats based on 37 different classes. Using a dataset containing thousands of images, we used deep neural networks (CNN) to train our model. For performance reasons, we created the model based on the convolution architecture of the pre-trained VGG19 model and fine-tuned it to achieve 53% performance on the training set and 41% performance on the test set.
