### Classification of Dog and Cat breed images using Deep Learning (CNN): Dataset Oxford-IIIT Pet

[Publication](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15lHg76RswLNc0HIqBtJIFVHA5w1CRjT2?authuser=1#scrollTo=UuGAaBXuoHW1)

The main objective of this project is to develop a classification model capable of differentiating dogs and cats based on 37 different classes. Using a dataset containing thousands of images, we used deep neural networks (CNN) to train our model. For performance reasons, we created the model based on the convolution architecture of the pre-trained VGG19 model and fine-tuned it to achieve 53% performance on the training set and 41% performance on the test set.

### Image Processing Project

[Publication](https://huggingface.co/spaces/StephaneBah/Image_Processing)

This application allows you to perform several operations on images, such as: Gaussian and Mean Filters, Binarization, Resizing, Rotation, Morphological Transformations (Dilation and Erosion)
